I am using GPT as a mentor. I have provided it with context to serve as a guide instead of simply providing all the answers. This is its suggestion for a six-month plan.

<h1>6-Month Web Dev Roadmap (Personal Projects)</h1>

<h2>Month 1 – Foundations (HTML, CSS, JS basics)</h2>

<b>Main Quest:</b>

Learn semantic HTML, CSS selectors, and simple JS (variables, functions, loops, events).

Build a personal website with a navbar, multiple pages, and GitHub deployment.

Practice commits: feature branch → merge into main.

Side Quests (optional projects):

🧮 Calculator (DOM manipulation + events).

⏱️ Stopwatch / digital clock (practice setInterval).

🎲 Random quote generator (arrays + randomness).

Month 2 – DOM & Interactivity

Main Quest:

Add interactivity: forms, inputs, event listeners.

Style your UI → experiment with dark mode toggle (store choice in localStorage).

Make sure your layout is responsive (basic flexbox/grid).

Side Quests:

📝 Notes app (simple text + localStorage).

🎨 Theme customizer (change font size, background, save settings).

💰 Simple budget tracker (add/remove items, sum totals, persist in storage).

Month 3 – Persistence & State Management

Main Quest:

Work on saving/retrieving user data (cookies & localStorage).

Create a todo list app with priority levels (persist tasks).

Learn basic UI best practices: spacing, alignment, readability.

Side Quests:

🌤️ Weather widget (fetch data from API).

🔄 Unit converter (C↔F, km↔miles).

⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts for your site (/ = focus search bar, etc.).

Month 4 – APIs & Data Handling

Main Quest:

Learn how to fetch data from APIs using fetch + async/await.

Expand IT-related tools (subnetting calculator, wire gauge tool).

Clean up UI → reusable header/footer/navbar across pages.

Side Quests:

🧑‍💻 GitHub user finder (fetch user/repos via GitHub API).

🎬 Movie search tool (OMDb API).

💱 Currency converter (live exchange rates).

Month 5 – UI/UX & Modular Design

Main Quest:

Refactor code → break JS into smaller functions.

Add dark mode toggle with persistence.

Polish your main UI → consistent design, spacing, and color choices.

Side Quests:

🌍 Weather dashboard (multiple cities, save favorites).

🗂️ Kanban board (Trello-like, draggable tasks, persisted state).

📝 Markdown notes app (render Markdown → HTML).

Month 6 – Advanced Projects & Showcase

Main Quest:

Deploy polished version of your website (GitHub Pages or Netlify).

Document your projects (README + screenshots).

Try building a simple full app (combine UI, persistence, APIs).

Side Quests (big boss fights 💪):

🤖 Chatbot page (connect to LLM API like OpenAI).

🛠️ Full Armstrong number generator/checker (tie back to your early learning).

🎨 Portfolio polish → responsive design, animations, favicon, SEO basics.
