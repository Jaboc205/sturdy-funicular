Beginner instructions on how to use git

Open Git
cd into the correct folder
git init //if new project
git add . //saves all files to git?
git commit -m 'your changes to this commit' //saves to memory?
git log //shows the times we saved. You can use the hash to recover these files
git checkout <hash from commit logs> //lets you work on a previous version that you committed
git remote add origin <github url> //links this to GitHub
git pull origin master //pull from GitHub
git push -u origin main //pushes to Github
