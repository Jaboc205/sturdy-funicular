  2. git pull origin main 

2. Create a feature branch // Optional for if we want to have a split production branch and development branch
  1. git checkout -b feature/<featureName> // -b == create new branch 'feature'/the sub branch

3. Save and commit changes
  1. git add . // . == all
  2. git commit -m "notes on what changes are in this commit"

4. Push the branch to github
  1. git push -u origin <branch> eg main or feature/<featureName>


If you want to update a branch eg. UIUpdates with the main code in order to add to it in another branch:
  1. git checkout <branch you wish to overwrite>
  2. git reset --hard main
  3. git push origin <branch you wish to overwrite> --force
